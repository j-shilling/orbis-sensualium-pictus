# Orbis Sensualium Pictus

After a few years of lazily speaking Latin without much diligence or study, I've decided to try to return to my former goal of commiting the *Orbis Pictus* to memory. This still to me seems like one of the best ways to quickly develop a wide vocabulary of everday topics. To reach this goal I want: 1) a transcript of the Latin text with macros, 2) a memory aid with all but the first letter of each word removed (i.e. *mundus* -> *m----*).

## Workflow

I am working with a 1887 English Edition found here: https://archive.org/details/cu3192403249945

Personally, I'm don't have the best eye for where macrons should go, so I am using this tool here: http://alatius.com/macronizer/ and consulting the dictionary when an ambiguity is marked. If you notice a macron missing or in the wrong place, please let me know either by creating a GitHub issue, or by email (shilling.jake@gmail.com).
